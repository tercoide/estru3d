<p>	Welcome to <font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Estru 3D </font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">beta
0.1</font>, this program is a tool to help solving structural systems
using the  Stiffness Matrix Method .  Using this implies the total
agreement of the  <a href="condic.htm">Termns and Conditions</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p> The software adress architects and engeneeres, as well as studens
or another degrees the entitles doing signeture structural
calculations. Why still beta? Beta versions are published to help the
development of the software itseff with the feedback of the users. It
is also Open Source under the GNU General Public License. I
personally use it on my professional work, and it was cross checked
with all the problems I could find. Even that results were correct
all these years, it is allways a good advice to cross check the
calculatios with hand made, or with another piece of software. As it
is stated in the Terms, there is no guarentee or liability about the
use of this software, being the results correct or incorrect. Please
keep that in mind.

<p>If you are familiarized with this type of programs and the method
