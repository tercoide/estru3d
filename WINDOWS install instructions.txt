MS Windows installation:

1-Requirements:
	Windows 10 (version preview from Insider Program recommended)
	Windows Linux Subsystem ( version 2 is recommended ) 
		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install
	WLS Ubuntu or similar distribution (free download from the Store)
	XvSrv X server winows manager
		https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/

2-Install:
	Look for the Ubuntu icon in your program menu and run. 
	Look for the XvXSrv and run, simply click “Ok” or “Continue” until the program options, run them with “-ac” 	clause.
	Once you have the Linux distribution running, install Gambas3 :

		http://gambas.sourceforge.net/en/main.html
	
	or simply copy and paste this (you wil be asked for the password the first time):

	$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gambas-team/gambas3
	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install gambas3
	that will install the Gambas3 programming enviroment in your system. Now we need to download estru3D:

	$ wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/estru3d/files/latest/download  -O estru3d.tar.gz

	after the download, we need to extract it

	$ tar -zxvf estru3d.tar.gz

	Now we car run Gambas3, but first we setup this enviroment variable for the X Window system:
	
	$ export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0
	$ gambas3 

	and from there, load estru3d source and run it. 

	Not too easy for install, but after it you will need to run the last 2 commnads to use it.
	
	Good luck and contact me for help.
